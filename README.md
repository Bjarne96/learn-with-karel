# First Time Setup
    1.  Create .env file in main directory
    2.  Set mongodb uri and replace <pw> in "MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://karel_admin:<pw>@karel.d2mf003.mongodb.net"
    3.  Run "npm i" in the console to install all modules.
    4.  Run "npm run dev" in the console to start dev server.
    
# Changes and Builds
    Create a branch and only push on main when your changes are completed. To reduce buildtime on netlify.
    Run "npm run build" to test your changes before you push / merge them on main (mainly for es lint errors)
